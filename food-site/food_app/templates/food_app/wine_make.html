    <h1>How To Make Homemade Wine - You're guide from crush to tasting.</h1>
  </section>

  <section class='content overview'>

    <p>
      My family has been making wine in our garage for over 20 years.  First, we bought buckets of wine juice but quickly realized 
      that this was only unlocking part of the potential that our wine could have.  In 2015 we decided to throw the juice away
      and buy some grapes sourced from all over the world at our local market.  Depending on the season we might buy grapes
      that were grown in Chile or grapes that were grown in California as their growing seasons are different based off their 
      location relative to the equator.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the past couple of years we have seen great success (we think so!) in our wine's body, taste, color and tannins.
      We are able to differentiate our wine from other's because of the attention to detail we put into our processes. 
      
    </p>
    <p>
      There's just something about making your own stuff.  There's a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction that 
      comes with it. Whether you are bored and looking for a hobby, tired of 
      all of the sub-par wine floating on the shelves or just have a passion for wine you will love making it.
      You will cherish this time to bond with friends, family and make lifetime memories that you look fondly back on.
    </p>

    <h1>Before We Get Started...</h1>
    <p>
      After we determine what kind of wine we want to make and how much, we can go about sourcing our grapes.  It's important to note
      that regular grapes we eat are not the same as the ones we use for wine consumption. Rather we must find a specialized seller that sells grapes grown for 
      the purpose of wine making.  Wine grapes are much smaller and packed with seeds to help give the wine it's tannins.
      Before we buy our grapes, there are a few things to consider:    
    </p>
    <p>
    <div class='items-to-consider'>
      <div class='item-icon'>
        <h5>Cost</h5>
        <img src="{% static '/images/icons/dollar-symbol.svg' %}">
      </div>
      <div class='item-icon'>
        <h5>Harvest Method</h5>
        <img src="{% static '/images/icons/harvester.svg' %}">
      </div>
      <div class='item-icon'>
        <h5>Wine Type</h5>
        <img src="{% static '/images/icons/grapes.svg' %}">
      </div>
      <div class='item-icon'>
        <h5>Vineyard Environment</h5>
        <img src="{% static '/images/icons/vineyard.svg' %}">
      </div>

    </div>
    </p>

    <p>Each of these can play a pivotal role in how your end product tastes. For instance, machine harvested grapes
      can taste different from grapes harvested by hand due to the cold, metallic essence of the machine touching the grape skins.
      The quality of the grapes is directly correlated to the cost, and you may find yourself asking: "How much am I 
      willing to pay to make my wine better?".  I like to think it's about finding a happy medium.  Growing environment and vineyard location
      play crucial parts in grape quality, leaning on the amount of direct sunlight, saturation/moistness of the soil and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      While things to consider, you don't need to drive yourself crazy trying to research 
      all of these aspects.  Once you have found your grapes and our happy, we can start to begin our process!
    </p>

  <section class=' content prep'>
    <h1>The Importance of Cleaning and Sanitizing</h1>
    <p>
      Making wine from start to finish is a very long, arduous process where we use many tools and storage devices, conduct our measurements 
      with many devices, and through the ageing process, must combat many environmental and chemical challenges.    
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore, it is absolutely critical that we sanitize and clean all of our buckets, barrels, and anything else we use to handle our wine with completeness 
      and frequency. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul class='cleaning-bullets'>
        <li>B-Bright: Heavy duty chemical that is used to clean glass and hard to remove debris</li>
        <li>Pottasium metabisulfite (K-Meta): Chemical that santizes tools, buckets and grapes.  Able to be used liberally, needs rinsed when finished.</li>
        <li>One-Step: Cleaner that is used for hard to get places like filtering tubes.  Does not need to be rinsed</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      We are able to use chemicals like B-Bright that clean fermentation residue from our oak barrels and anything wooden we utlize.  We use Potassium metabisulfite (K-meta) to santize anything plastic 
      like our plastic buckets , fermentation barrels, filters or tubes in frequent sanitation iterations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once we set up our cleaning workflow throughout the process, we can begin to crush our grapes!
    </p>

        <li>Crusher</li>

      </ul>
  </div>
    <p>
      Finally, we are able to start our wine making journey!  Crushing the grape opens the berry up for fermentation. It also allows the the berries, pulp, skins, and seeds to all inter mingle in a mixture, each lending their flavor, aroma, and natural chemicals
      to the each other. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Before throwing your grapes in for crushing, there is an importance in prepping your grapes by checking for leaves, bugs or even white mold.
      It is critical to rid your grapes of any mold as it can introduce bacteria later on.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the old days you may have seen images of people crushing grapes with their feet with grape juice all up their legs, but in modern times have constructed tools
      to crush the grapes for us.  We use an electric crusher and destemmer. This allows the grapes to be thrown into the machine where the berries are crushed and the stems 
      are discarded through another outlet, leaving only berries, skins and seeds. After each grape crate is crushed, it must be then
      dumped into the fermentation barrel.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every two or three grapes cases, we must add a K-Meta into our fermentation barrels.  This chemical fumes sanitize ours grapes and kills the wild yeast that is natural to them. While particular grapes can ferment really well with wild yeast,
        it is not recommended as you don't know how it will end.  Fermentation may occur too little or too much and ruin the wine.  That's why it's a good idea to kill all the wild yeast
        and add commercialized yeast instead.

    <h1>Primary Fermentation</h1>
    <h5>5 days - 2 weeks</h5>
    <img class='img-fluid prim-ferm-img' src="{% static 'images/fermentation.jpg' %}">
    <h4>Checklist of Items</h4>

      </ul>
  </div>

    <p>Before We get into primary fermentation, there are a few things we must prepare and check before adding in our commercialized yeast</p>

    

    <p>
        After you crush and have your mixture of must (freshly produced mixture of berries, seeds, and skins), we go through a process that allows the juice and skins to rest together 
        at a cold temperature to extract more flavor and color from the skins.  This process is known as Maceration (also known as Cold Soaking) and must be done prior to Primary Fermentation.

        The longer you cold soak the skins and juice the better.
        We must be careful of this and add in our commercialized yeast around 36 hours after crushing.  

    </p>

    <p>
      Before adding in the yeast, we must check the Specific Gravity (SG) of the juice. This indicates the amount of fermentable sugar in the must. As we keep a note of that, we can track how fermentation is progressing as sugar is converted to alcohol.
      We can measure SG by using a hydrometer. 
    </p>

    <h4 style='font-weight: bold;'>What is a Hydrometer and how do we use it?</h4>
    <p>
      The hydrometer allows us to measure the progress of fermentation and alcohol percentage.  In order to use the hydrometer, we simply take a small sample of our must and lower the hydrometer into the sample.  We then spin the hydrometer to eliminate any air bubbles 
      that may cling to the side of the hydrometer.  Once stopped moving, we can take our SG reading and write it down.  
    </p>

    <p>
        In wine fermentation, nearly all the sugar is converted to alcohol.  As you gather your final reading before draining and pressing, the reading is 
        often negative and must be added to your original SG measurement as alcohol is lighter than water. 

    </p>

    <p>
      For example, if our initial measurement = 12.5 and final measurement = -.7, then we would simply take the sum of the absolute value of these two numbers together to get the alcohol percentage of the wine to be 13.2%.
    </p>

    <p>
        As discussed before, adding in commerical yeast in place of the wild yeast killed during crushing, gives us more control over fermentation. Primary Fermentation is the most critical step in the process and accounts for  
        90% of the alcohol produced by converting the natural sugars in the grapes to alcohol and Carbon Dioxide (CO2). As we add in our yeast, we must also help keep the yeast fed as it can dry out and die. 
    </p>

    <p>
      As a rule of thumb, the slower the fermentation the better. Temperature control is crucial as too cold of an environment can delay the yeast 
      and too hot can give off flavors.
    </p>

    <p>
      During primary fermentation, we keep an eye on the fermentation barrels and engage in processes known as punchdowns and pumpovers.  These help us to mix the fermentation.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Punchdowns</strong>: As fermentation begins to occur, all the solids of the must float to the top, creating a cap that traps all the CO2 being produced, beneath.
      'Punching Down' is the term winemakers use to break the cap and help release the CO2 and mix the skins with juice in order to maximize tannins and color.  This is simply done by taking an object and
      pushing down on the cap until it breaks and mixing the solid cap into the juice until id dissolves.  Below, we can see this in action.
    </p>

      </video>

    <p>
      <strong>Pumpovers</strong>: The process of draining the juice from the bottom of the barrel and pouring it over the must at the top.  This helps with aeration of the juice
      that contribute to color, flavor and tannins.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each day, it's important to check the SG until it gets to your target measurement.  For Red wines, a good measurement is between 0.993 - 0.996. Once your must has the appropriate measurement, we can move onto draining the free run juice and pressing
      all of the leftover berries and skins for the remaining juice.

  </div>
    <p>
      Once primary fermentation comes to an end, we can proceed to draining all the wine juice from the fermentation barrels.
      The juice produced during the drain is called 'free run' which flows freely from the barrel and where most of the wine juice is 
      extracted. The quality of this juice is much higher than the juice we receive from pressing.
    </p>

    <p>
      When all the free run juice is drained from the fermentation barrel, we can scoop the all the remaining grapes from the fermentation barrel and 
      place them in the wine press.  We have to be careful here not to include too many seeds in our press.  Seeds contribute to tannin levels and too many tannins 
      may throw off our flavor and yield an overpowering taste.
    </p>

    <p>
      As we dump the grapes in the press, we need a way for the juice to continue to flow when we get to the point where the press is applying pressure 
      to a large lump of grapes still with some juice left in them but unable to drain through the already thick, dried up grapes.  In order to have some sort of fluidity into this 
      large lump of damp grapes, we add rice hulls which, pust inbetween grape dumps, acts as a vessel for the grape juice to flow freely to the bottom and out of the press into the buckets. 
    </p>

    </video>
    <p>
      There are many different ways to press the grapes to yield the remaining juice. We use a wine press with a crank that has blocks on top.  As you turn the crank, the blocks apply
      downward pressure on the grapes that exponges the juice and allows it flow out of an opening at the bottom to a bucket.

    <p>
        After all the juice is drained and pressed from the fermentation barrels, we can transfer our yield to carboys where it will sit for 2 months.   
    </p>

    <p>
      At this point, we have our wine in glass carboys plugged at the top with cleaning agents (K-meta) to help keep bacteria away.  We now kick off a process known 
      as Cold Stablization.  This process involves exposing the wine to a cold environment and helps to clarify it, dragging all the remaining unwanted residue 
      to the bottom.  Cold temperature helps to sink items that are greater than the density of the liquid.
    </p>

    <p>
      As Cold Stablization progresses, the high acid level of the juice is lowered and pH rises.  For a red wine, the target pH level is between 3.3 - 3.6. 
      However, our wine tends to be 3.8 pH as we cold stabilize for longer.  The higher the pH level, the higher the sulfite levels to be to stabilize it.

      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      Once cold stabilzation completes with the appropriate pH levels, we can then transfer the wine 
      into oak barrels.
    </p>

    <p>
      The wine will now age in these barrels for many reasons, but the main being for the oaky flavor of the barrel that lends itself to 
      the wine.  There are many types of oak barrels (French, American, Hungarian, etc).  We prefer American or French oak as they last for long 
      periods of time and give off great flavors.  The oaky flavor of the barrel lasts around two years, but the barrel itself can still be used past that if proper 
      measurements are taken to maintain it. To add flavor, we are able to use what are known as oak sticks which we can attach to wire and submerge in the wine 
      while it's in the barrel to replace the oak flavor lost inherent to the barrel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another reason we choose to age in a barrel is to endure microoxygenation where we introduce oxygen to the wine 
      in a controlled way.  Through this, we are able to bring out fine aromas and texture to the wine that would be rather difficult to 
      gain through non-traditional ageing methods like titanium containers.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, we add our wine to our American oak barrels with a french oak stick submerged.  The duration of ageing is dependant on the availability of the barrels for other wines and wine type.  
      Different wines require different barrel ageing durations.  However, our wines require at least 6 months, whereafter it's up to personal preferance. For others, the longer the wine is in the barrel, the longer it can maintain it's integrity in a bottle. 
      Typically, we only age our wines for 6 months as we engage in seasonal wine sessions in the fall and spring so we need a barrel to store our wine when the time comes.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Over these few months, as microoxygenation is occuring, small amounts of water are being evaporated from the barrel, lowering the wine level with bacteria building that could potentially 
      turn the wine into vinegar.  To combat this, we add sulfites to the wine to help sanitize it.  In order to keep the wine volume level with our initial filling, we must top off the wine barrels every two months 
      with wine conserved during draining and pressing.  
    </p>

      Once the wine is considered appropiately aged, we are able to transfer the wine to our bottles.     
    </p>

    <p>
      Filtering our wine of any remaining residue is important before corking and bottling. We hook up a series of tubes to an electric filiter and run the wine 
      through it to our bottles.
    </p>

    <p>
      We then cork the bottles with our corker and set them aside.  The importance of corks cannot be overstated. If you want to age the wine for long periods of time 
      then you need good quality wine corks.  Two types of corks exist: Nautral corks and Synthetic works. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <span style='font-size: 25px;'>Natural Corks</span>: The natural essence of a cork is appealing to it's recycleability and biodegradable nature.  Nautural corks easily expand to fit fill the bottle 
      head, allowing to wine to leak out, trapping the aroma for years until opened.  However, natural corks can be expensive, fragile and susceptible to chemical taint.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span style='font-size: 25px;'>Synthetic Corks</span>: Corks made from recycled materials are very cheap in cost.  These corks have consistency of holding the oxygen out and no chemical taint. 
        These corks are also much more durable and protected against being degraded with time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once all the wines are corked in your bottles and stored away, you must wait atleast 4 months of bottle ageing before drinking.  The bottles also must be inverted with the wine pressed up against 
      the cork to help build up tolerance over time.

    <h1>Some Thoughts</h1>
    <p>
      Wine making is so much more than the science laid out here. Making this heavenly elixir is something special.  It is a time to bond with family and loved ones, 
      to make memories with new friends and a chance to pass down family secrets.  It is a labor of love and a celebration of the hands that crafted it.
